<h1>jQuery Selectopoly</h1>

<p>Selectopoly is a jQuery plugin that replaces a multiple value select field with several single value select fields that can be added and removed as required. This allows easier selection of values, with improved visibility of selected values.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Copy the Selectopoly file (either the uncompressed or the minified one) to your resources directory and then simply link to the file in your HTML document.</p>

<p>```html</p>

<script src="jquery-selectopoly.js" type="text/javascript"></script>


<p>```</p>

<p>To get up and running quickly, you can set Selectopoly to automatically match all <code>select</code> elements with the <code>multiple</code> attribute within the document by adding &ldquo;?auto&rdquo; to the end of the <code>script</code> element&rsquo;s <code>src</code> attribute.</p>

<p>```html</p>

<script src="jquery-selectopoly.js?auto" type="text/javascript"></script>


<p>```</p>

<h2>Using Selectopoly</h2>

<p>To run Selectopoly, simply run the function on any multi-value <code>select</code> elements matched with jQuery, like so:</p>

<p><code>javascript
$('select[multiple]').selectopoly();
</code></p>

<p>Remember that if you want to retrieve all of the selected values, the <code>name</code> attribute must include square brackets, e.g. &ldquo;field_name[]&rdquo;. If these are not present, the browser will only return the first selected value.</p>
