#jQuery Selectopoly

Selectopoly is a jQuery plugin that replaces a multiple value select field with several single value select fields that can be added and removed as required. This allows easier selection of values, with improved visibility of selected values.

##Requirements

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com)

##Installation

Copy the Selectopoly file (either the uncompressed or the minified one) to your resources directory and then simply link to the file in your HTML document.

```html
<script src="jquery-selectopoly.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

To get up and running quickly, you can set Selectopoly to automatically match all `select` elements with the `multiple` attribute within the document by adding "?auto" to the end of the `script` element's `src` attribute.

```html
<script src="jquery-selectopoly.js?auto" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

##Using Selectopoly

To run Selectopoly, simply run the function on any multi-value `select` elements matched with jQuery, like so:

```javascript
$('select[multiple]').selectopoly();
```

Remember that if you want to retrieve all of the selected values, the `name` attribute must include square brackets, e.g. "field_name[]". If these are not present, the browser will only return the first selected value.
